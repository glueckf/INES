"""Isolated push-pull scoring worker: given a topology id, a query id, a
placement, and (optionally) the player's own push/pull choices, reconstructs
that exact simulation context (same size/seed as export_scenario.py used)
and scores it using Kraken's own CostCalculator.

For a projection with no push choice given, this picks the cheapest
available communication strategy (push vs push-pull) at whatever node the
caller placed it — the same thing the "Sequential" baseline already does for
INEv's placement, generalized to any placement. For a projection where the
player DID choose a dependency to push (a raw primitive letter, or an
already-placed sub-query dependency by its own name), that exact choice is
costed instead via `forced_push_group` (prepp.py / cost_calculator.py) — so
a good push/pull call is rewarded and a bad one costs what it actually
costs, rather than always silently falling back to the optimizer's own pick.
The chosen dependency name is passed through as-is (not flattened to leaf
primitives) — PrePP's own forced-group matching is one-level, so a
flattened sub-query name would silently never match and fall through
unnoticed.

Runs as its own process (see server.py) so RNG state from scoring one
topology can never leak into another's reconstruction — the same reason
export_scenario.py isolates each topology into its own subprocess.

Usage: python score_one.py <topology_id> <scenario_id> '<placement-json>' ['<push-choice-json>']
push-choice-json (optional, default "{}"): {projection_name: primitive_letter}
— only for projections the player has made an explicit push/pull call on;
any projection missing from it falls back to the optimizer's own choice. The
value can also be ALL_PUSH ("__all_push__", mirrors state.ts) for an explicit
"push everything, pull nothing" choice — its own selectable option in the UI,
not just what happens when nothing was chosen.
Prints one JSON line to stdout: {"cost", "latency", "per_placement"} or
{"error": "..."} on failure (exit code 1).
