# Kraken Demo — Backlog

Internal working list, not a public issue tracker. Functional pieces first —
gamification is a polish pass once the demo actually demonstrates what Kraken
does.

## Functional (current priority)

1. **Extend communication** — DONE: a local push-pull scoring backend
   ([backend/server.py](backend/server.py)) reuses Kraken's own
   `CostCalculator`/`PlacementProblem` ([cost_calculator.py](../src/kraken/components/cost_calculator.py),
   [problem.py](../src/kraken/problem.py)) to pick the cheapest push/push-pull
   strategy per operator for whatever placement the user chose — the same
   model "Sequential" already uses for INEv's placement, generalized to any
   placement. Each request scores in its own subprocess
   ([export/score_one.py](export/score_one.py)), for the same RNG-isolation
   reason export_scenario.py isolates its own exports. `window.KRAKEN_BACKEND`
   in [index.html](web/index.html) points at it for local dev; not deployed
   anywhere yet.
   Also DONE: the player can now make the push/pull call themselves instead
   of it always being auto-optimized — a chip row per multi-dependency
   operator (`renderPushPullRow` in [panel.ts](web/src/panel.ts)) lets them
   pick which dependency gets pushed (rate shown per chip so the choice is
   informed), or leave it to the optimizer; **mandatory**, not optional —
   `state.readyToScore` blocks scoring until every such operator has a call
   (caught via testing: it was easy to silently skip). Chips are built from
   `proj.deps` (one level, respecting whatever an earlier operator already
   decided), not the fully flattened primitives — also caught via testing,
   the flattened version re-offered already-bundled primitives as if they
   were still independently decidable. Required a small additive change to
   `prepp.py`/`cost_calculator.py` (`forced_push_group`, default `None` —
   re-exported all 8 scenarios and diffed against committed JSON to confirm
   zero behavior change when unused) to cost the player's *specific* choice
   rather than always the cheapest one, so a bad call actually costs what it
   costs (verified: pushing the wrong/high-rate stream costs ~150x more,
   roughly all-push) instead of silently being corrected.
   **Correction (2026-09-08, see item #10):** that verification only ever
   exercised pushing a raw primitive — pushing an already-placed sub-query
   dependency was silently a no-op (always scored as the optimizer's own
   pick, regardless of the player's actual choice) from when this shipped
   until it was found and fixed today.
2. **Simplify the query representation** for a non-technical audience.
   Currently queries are shown as raw expressions (`SEQ(A, B, C)`), which
   reads as programming syntax rather than "spot the shark alarm."
3. **Let the user choose the network size** — DONE: 2 topologies export
   (`medium`=12 — the original hand-built reef, unchanged — `large`=24
   nodes), same 4 story queries on each, via `SimulationMode.SIZED_TOPOLOGY`
   in [simulation_environment.py](../src/simulation_environment.py) +
   subprocess-isolated export in
   [export_scenario.py](export/export_scenario.py) (isolation matters:
   sharing one process leaked RNG state from the sized-random topology into
   the untouched hardcoded one and shifted its numbers). Frontend has a
   topology selector alongside the query picker (`renderTopologyBar` in
   [panel.ts](web/src/panel.ts)); switching topology keeps the same query
   selected when it exists there. (A third, 8-node "small" topology was
   tried and dropped — not worth the extra scenario set for this pass.)
4. **Test the visualization at different network sizes** — DONE for
   12 vs. 24 nodes: the reef layout now spaces rows evenly across however
   many layers a topology actually has (`computeLayout` in
   [reef.ts](web/src/reef.ts)) instead of a fixed 4-row table, so large's
   5 layers no longer overflow the canvas. Found and fixed a real bug along
   the way: the layout cache was keyed by `scenario_id`, which isn't unique
   across topologies (every size has its own "seq_abc"), and a race where
   `loadScenario`'s loading-state emit fired with `topologyId` already
   switched but `state.scenario` still the old data — now keyed by the
   scenario object's identity instead of a derived string.
5. **Known limitation from #3: large collapses to 1 operator per query.**
   The hand-built 12-node reef is a deliberately hand-tuned multi-parent DAG
   with overlapping event placement (see `create_hardcoded_tree` in
   [simulation_environment.py:715](../src/simulation_environment.py:715)) —
   that's *why* combigen finds shared sub-results worth materializing there.
   Randomly generated topologies almost never do (tried ~120 seed/parameter
   combinations — node_event_ratio, max_parents, event_skew — virtually all
   collapse every query to a single placeable operator, since
   `get_best_chain_combis`/`return_partitioning` in
   [combigen.py:290](../src/simulator/combigen.py:290) make the
   split/materialize decision from real distances + rates, and random trees
   rarely produce the kind of overlapping-producer structure that makes it
   worthwhile). Getting a good 2–5-operator ramp at other sizes needs the
   same kind of hand-curated topology design that produced the 12-node reef,
   not a quick parameter tweak — worth a dedicated pass, not a side task.

## Gamification (later — once the above works)

- Weave the "Hai-Alarm" fairy-tale framing into the actual UI copy (query
  picker, task description, info modal), not just the spoken talk — e.g.
  frame query selection as "which alarm are you hunting" rather than an
  abstract `SEQ(...)` expression.
- Add a tangible reward moment (short animation/sound) for beating Kraken —
  a bare score delta (0.342 vs 0.298) doesn't land emotionally for a lay
  audience.
- Open question: accessibility for a diverse audience — German vs English UI
  copy, colorblind-safe palette check, mobile usability for a slam/QR-code
  crowd.

## Visual, from Science Slam audience feedback (2026-09-04)

Talk audience reaction to the current look was lukewarm — reference art from
the talk itself (Kraken-as-cartographer, King Cloud's island, watchtowers,
seahorse messengers, icon badges per query) sets a clearer bar than what's
in the demo now. Two concrete asks:

6. **Text is often too small, and query expressions read as raw
   programming syntax** — DONE: bumped font sizes across the reef labels,
   query bar, tray, push/pull chips, and scorecard/leaderboard (smallest
   text was 9-10.5px before); `titleWithIcons()` in
   [panel.ts](web/src/panel.ts) swaps each standalone event letter (A-F) in
   query titles/operator names for its icon via a `\b`-bounded regex (leaves
   "SEQ"/"AND" untouched), reusing `eventIconSvg` from
   [icons.ts](web/src/icons.ts) — the reef's leaf nodes already used these
   same glyphs. Query cards now also show their `emblem`
   (crab/turtle/shark/seedling, as emoji) — that field was already exported
   and typed but never rendered anywhere. Had to trim padding/gaps in
   several places afterward to offset the extra height from bigger text —
   the panel scrolls internally when it doesn't fit, but the simplest query
   started overflowing by >100px before the trim, which wasn't true before
   the font bump.
7. **Fog nodes read as "a bomb"** — DONE: after 3 self-critiqued SVG-geometry
   passes (tapered body/roof/window/flag, see git history on
   [reef.ts](web/src/reef.ts)) still didn't feel close enough to the talk's
   own reference art, fog nodes now render the actual reference illustration
   (`/home/aziehn/Dokumente/PhD/ScienceSlam/Icons/tower_2.png`, the
   already-transparent one of the two tower renders provided) as an SVG
   `<image>` (`towerShape` in [reef.ts](web/src/reef.ts)), cropped to its
   opaque bounds and downsized to `demo/web/assets/tower.png` (431×480,
   alpha preserved — checked corner-pixel alpha is 0, not white-baked-in).
   Node's own `.node-dot` circle stays underneath it. `build.mjs` now
   copies `web/assets/` into `dist/`, and `serve.mjs`'s MIME map got
   `.png`/`.jpg` entries (previously only html/js/css/json/wasm/svg were
   mapped — png would've fallen through to `application/octet-stream`,
   which some browsers still render fine as `<img>`/`<image>` but isn't
   correct); the asset is excluded from the root `.gitignore`'s blanket
   `*.png` rule via `git add -f` (that rule is meant for research-output
   plots, not shipped app assets).
9. **King Cloud island + tower placement, follow-up (2026-09-04)** — DONE:
   the hand-drawn island/castle/pool/palm/crown SVG group (`islandPath`,
   `castleGroup`, `poolAndPalm`, `crownGroup` — all removed) is replaced the
   same way item 7 replaced the tower: the cloud node now renders
   `kingcloud_2.png` (the transparent one of the two king-cloud renders,
   cropped to opaque bounds → `demo/web/assets/kingcloud.png`, 640×606) as
   an `<image>` (`cloudImageBox` in [reef.ts](web/src/reef.ts)); the
   "König Cloud" label moved to just below the image instead of overlaid
   on it (the full scene is too busy to write over legibly). Towers also
   nudged down slightly (`bottomY` in `towerShape` moved from `cy + r*0.55`
   to `cy + r*0.85`) per request to sit closer to the source-node row
   below — re-verified no row-to-row overlap on `large` (24 nodes) after
   the shift (still a 20px+ gap on both sides). Also fixed a regression
   from item 7: the tower/cloud `<image>` elements had `pointer-events:
   none` (so only the small foundation dot was actually clickable — before
   the image swap, the *entire* hand-drawn SVG tower shape was part of the
   clickable `<g>`, so this had shrunk the hit area without anyone asking
   for that); removed the rule so the images themselves are click-targets
   again, confirmed via `getScreenCTM`-based coordinate mapping +
   `elementFromPoint` that a click on the tower artwork (not just the dot)
   now resolves to the right `data-node`. The remaining reference images
   (`correls.png`, `correls_2.png`) are still full multi-subject scenes,
   not pre-cropped icons — revisit if a use for them comes up.

## Push-pull feature (2026-09-04 → 2026-09-08)

10. **"All-push is valid right now — you have to force one push/pull [choice]."**
    Clarified (2026-09-08): the complaint was about the mandatory-choice hint
    itself — "Still need a push/pull call for SEQ(A, B), SEQ(A, B, D),
    SEQ(A, B, C, D)" kept firing even though all-push is a legitimate
    strategy, because the chip UI only ever let you pick *one specific*
    dependency to push (implicitly pulling the rest) — there was no way to
    explicitly say "push everything" and have that count as a made
    decision. DONE: added `ALL_PUSH` (`"__all_push__"`, [state.ts](web/src/state.ts))
    as a real, selectable third option — a `push all` chip alongside the
    per-dependency ones in `renderPushPullRow` ([panel.ts](web/src/panel.ts)),
    same mandatory toggle mechanics as the existing chips (`setPushChoice`
    needed no changes, it's generic on the string value). When active,
    every per-dependency chip in that row also displays as `PUSH` (true to
    what's actually happening — nothing is pulled), verified via DOM
    inspection.

    **Also found and fixed a real, previously-shipped correctness bug while
    building this** (i.e. item #1's "communication extend," marked DONE
    2026-09-04, was silently broken for one whole class of input since it
    shipped): a player's push/pull choice was only ever actually honored
    when they pushed a **raw primitive** (e.g. "A"). Pushing an
    **already-placed sub-query dependency** (e.g. "SEQ(A, B)") looked
    identical in the UI (chip highlighted, hint cleared, a score came back)
    but the choice was silently discarded and the optimizer's own pick was
    scored instead — confirmed by forcing every variation of a sub-query
    dependency's push (flattened leaves `["A","B"]`, a single leaf `["A"]`)
    across 36+ placement combinations and finding the result *always*
    matched the unforced optimum exactly, while forcing a raw primitive
    (`["D"]`) reliably diverged from it every time. Root cause: PrePP's
    `forced_push_group` matching (`old_copy = query.primitive_operators` in
    `determine_randomized_distribution_push_pull_costs`, [prepp.py](../src/prepp/prepp.py))
    operates on the query's **one-level** dependency tokens — a sub-query
    dependency appears there as its own name string ("SEQ(A, B)"), never
    expanded — but `score_one.py` was flattening the player's sub-query
    choice to its leaf primitives (`dep_obj.leafs()`) before passing it,
    which then matches nothing in that one-level list; the intersection
    silently comes back empty and the code falls through to the regular
    search, with no error or signal that the player's choice was ignored.
    Fixed by passing the chosen dependency's own name through unflattened
    (`forced_push_group=[chosen_dep]`) — re-verified clean (0/20 failures)
    across a systematic placement scan that a forced sub-query choice now
    reliably diverges from the optimizer's own pick exactly like a forced
    primitive choice does. Docstrings on `forced_push_group`
    ([prepp.py](../src/prepp/prepp.py),
    [cost_calculator.py](../src/kraken/components/cost_calculator.py)) were
    themselves wrong in the same way (described flattening as correct) —
    corrected, since that's very likely *why* the original bug happened.

    A **second, separate bug** turned up chasing this: forcing every one of
    a query's dependencies into a *single* group (i.e. "push everything,
    nothing left to pull" — needed for the `push all` chip above) doesn't
    reproduce the true all-push cost either — off by a division-like factor
    in several tested placements (e.g. 609.0 instead of the correct 1827.0).
    Not root-caused (looks like a bug in how PrePP turns a single-group,
    no-`rest` plan into acquisition steps, downstream of the fix above) —
    worked around rather than fixed: `push all` in `score_one.py` doesn't
    go through `forced_push_group` at all, it directly uses
    `cost_calculator.calculate(..., forced_push_group=None)`'s first entry
    (`_compute_all_push_costs`'s result, always present, unaffected by any
    forced-group path) — reliable by construction, verified against known
    all-push numbers. If a real forced-single-group use case ever comes up,
    this second bug still needs a proper root-cause pass.

    Re-investigated the earlier "identical cost regardless of which
    dependency is forced" finding from the first pass at this item in light
    of the above — that specific case (both dependencies co-located at the
    same node, distance 0 either way) is still a genuine coincidence and
    not an instance of either bug, confirmed by re-running it after the fix
    and getting the same result.

    End-to-end tested through the real UI (topology → query → place all
    three operators at König Cloud → force a sub-query dependency's push
    directly, and separately toggle `push all` per operator → mandatory-
    choice hint clears both ways → backend round-trip returns a correctly
    differentiated `push-pull optimised` score), including the toggle-off
    path restoring the pending state.

    Still open: `state.ts`'s `rescore()` shows the client's instant
    all-push `Engine.score()` estimate as the *official* score immediately
    (before `readyToScore` even existed this made sense; now the player has
    already committed to a real push/pull decision by the time a score
    shows at all, so showing an all-push number first is a separate,
    smaller rough edge) — only the backend's async `refine()` flips it to
    the real push-pull number, silently staying on the estimate forever if
    the backend is unreachable. Not the thing the user was flagging today,
    but worth a look if it comes up again: block on the backend round-trip
    vs. make the interim "estimate" label more prominent in the scorecard.
11. **Kraken-plan reveal, improved toward push/pull edges.** Currently
    `toggleReveal()`/`view.reveal` in [reef.ts](web/src/reef.ts) only draws
    a ghost ring (`class="ghost"`) around whichever node Kraken placed each
    subquery on — it shows *where*, not *how it communicates*. The ask
    (as given) is to extend this toward showing push vs. pull on the
    edges themselves — e.g. color or dash-style the edge between a
    dependency and its consumer according to Kraken's own push/pull
    strategy for that edge, mirroring the push/pull chip UI's push/pull
    coloring. Not scoped: needs (a) the reveal payload to actually carry
    per-edge push/pull info (right now `view.reveal` is just
    `Record<string, number>` — subquery → node, no strategy attached; the
    backend's `per_placement[name].strategy` from `score_one.py` has this
    but it isn't currently threaded into the reveal path at all), and (b)
    a design pass on how that reads visually next to the existing
    push/pull chip colors without the reef getting busier than the
    legibility work (item 6) just fixed.

## Engine (research code, not demo) — flagged, not scoped

8. **Enable Kraken's multi-node ("MS") placement.** Currently explicitly
   left out of the integrated search — per the TODOs in the algorithm:
   `# ComputeMSPlacement` / `# TODO: Currently leave out MS placement for
   integrated approach, as it is not yet implemented` /
   `partType,_,_ = returnPartitioning(self, projection, unfolded[projection],
   projrates, criticalMSTypes)` (commented out). INEv's separate placement
   already uses this partitioning (`return_partitioning`/`get_savings` in
   [combigen.py:290](../src/simulator/combigen.py:290)); Kraken's own joint
   search doesn't yet consider it. This is a real algorithmic gap in the
   core research contribution, not a demo-polish item — needs its own
   scoping pass (where exactly in `kraken/problem.py`'s `expand()` /
   `CostCalculator` this would plug in, what "multi-node" changes about a
   `PlacementInfo`/`SolutionCandidate`) before estimating effort. Not
   touched today.
