    Note from Finn GlÃ¼ck 27.08.2024:

    Changed x from 0.1 to 0.2 and y from 0.01 to 0.05 to make selectivities generally higher.
    Added max_rate to scale selectivities based on the highest event rate.
    This hopefully prevents extremely high output rates for projections with high-rate inputs.

    Changed random_float range from 0.0 - 0.3 to 0.0 - 0.4 and adjusted conditions from >0.2 to >0.3
    This decreases the chance of a selectivity being set to 1, making high selectivities less freuquent.
